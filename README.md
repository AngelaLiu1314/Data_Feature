Data Features: Calorie Counter

This data feature combines two APIS:
1. EDAMAN Recipie API
2. EDAMAN Nutrition Analysis API

First, this data feature prompts users for 1 ingredient. Then the program runs the ingredient through the EDAMAN recipie API to find the top recipie. 

Second, this data feature will analyze the ingredients from the recipie and then calculate the calories from this recipie.

Finally, this data feature will return the top recipie, its ingredients, and the calories for the recipie.

The user can keep inputting ingredients until they find a recipie that they want.
